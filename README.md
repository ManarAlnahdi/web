The task is to create the robot's movements and directions and link them to the database
First, the database server was loaded

Then the robot's directions page was designed and special buttons were added (right, left, back, forward)

The page was designed in HTML and added CSS and JS

After that, special PHP codes were written to link to the database

Finally, a table was created in the database and the last movement of the robot was added

Note: I do not know why the trend is not added to the database table even though the connection to the database is correct
